\cf0 Kiss me hard before you go\
Summertime sadness\
I just wanted you to know\
That baby you're the best\
\
I got my red dress on tonight\
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight\
Got my hair up real big beauty queen style\
High heels off, I'm feeling alive\
\
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air\
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare\
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere\
Nothing scares me anymore\
}

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh

I'm feeling' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast going' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh

I think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies
Later is better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive

I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summer time sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh
